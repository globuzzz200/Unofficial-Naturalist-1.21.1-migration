## üì¶ Required Assets

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT:** This repository does **NOT** include the required assets (textures, models, animations, sounds, data) due to licensing restrictions.

### How to Obtain Assets

1. **Download** the original Naturalist mod for Minecraft 1.20.1:
   - https://github.com/starfish-studios/Naturalist/

2. **Extract** the following directories from the 1.20.1 mod:
   ```
   Naturalist-Arch-1.20.1/common/src/main/resources/
   Naturalist-Arch-1.20.1/fabric/src/main/resources/
   ```

3. **Copy** these directories to replace the empty ones in this project:
   ```
   common/src/main/resources/     ‚Üê Copy content here
   fabric/src/main/resources/     ‚Üê Copy content here
   ```

### Asset Compatibility

This 1.21.1 version includes **flexible animation loading** that supports:
- **Old format:** `.rp_anim.json` files (from 1.20.1)
- **New format:** `.animation.json` files  

The mod will automatically detect and use whichever format is available.

## Building

**Prerequisites:** Ensure you have copied the required assets as described above.

```bash
cd /path/to/directory/
./gradlew build
```

The built mod jar will be in `fabric/build/libs/`.

### Without Assets
If you try to build without assets, the mod will compile but **will not function properly** in-game (missing textures, models, animations, etc.).
